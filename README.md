#	Develop a statement of purpose and scope for your application. It must include:
- describe at a high level what the application will do
- identify the problem it will solve and explain why you are developing it
- identify the target audience
- explain how a member of the target audience will use it

The application will randomly generate a word and the user has to guess the word, the user will have 5 chances to guess the word incorrectly then the game will end afterwards. The target audince for the game is anyone who visits my github, this could be my peers, educators or future employers. The target audience will use this as a fun interactive game.


# Develop a list of features that will be included in the application. It must include:
- at least THREE features
- describe each feature

# Note: Ensure that your features above allow you to demonstrate your understanding of the following language elements and concepts:
- use of variables and the concept of variable scope
- loops and conditional control structures
- error handling


I would like the hangman game to be a very interactive game, I would like for it to have a start, exit and new game feature. The words used will probably be programming terminology that is frequently used to make it more interactive for the educators/students.

# Develop an outline of the user interaction and experience for the application.
Your outline must include:
- how the user will find out how to interact with / use each feature
- how the user will interact with / use each feature
- how errors will be handled by the application and displayed to the user

With each feature, there are specific instructions that will be written on screen for the game, it tells the user how to interact with each feature and how to go back tpo the main screen once completed.


# Develop a diagram which describes the control flow of your application. Your diagram must:
- show the workflow/logic and/or integration of the features in your application for each feature.
- utilise a recognised format or set of conventions for a control flow diagram, such as UML.
