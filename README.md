The application will randomly generate a word and the user has to guess the word, the user will have 5 chances to guess the word incorrectly then the game will end afterwards. The target audince for the game is anyone who visits my github, this could be my peers, educators or future employers. The target audience will use this as a fun interactive game.


# Develop a list of features that will be included in the application. It must include:
- at least THREE features
- describe each feature

# Note: Ensure that your features above allow you to demonstrate your understanding of the following language elements and concepts:
- use of variables and the concept of variable scope
- loops and conditional control structures
- error handling


I would like the hangman game to be a very interactive game, I would like for it to have a start, exit and new game feature. The words used will probably be programming terminology that is frequently used to make it more interactive for the educators/students.
